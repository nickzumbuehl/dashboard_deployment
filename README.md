# ReadMe: Dashboard - LSTM Neural Networks and HAR Models for Realized Volatility - An Application to Financial Volatility Forecasting

This repository aims to illustrate the results of the thesis - LSTM Neural Networks and HAR Models for Realized Volatility - An Application to Financial Volatility Forecasting. This repository only contains code for the dashboard, all the remaining code is located [here](https://github.com/nickzumbuehl/master_thesis).

## General Infomation
The dashboard runs under the url: http://nick-vola.herokuapp.com. Please note that the website might take a moment to load, as free herokuapps go to sleep mode when not used for 30 minutes. Moreover, free heroku apps are limited to run up to 1000 hours per month. In the unlikely case that the web application fails to load, please contact the author of the paper.

Alternatively, the dashboard can also be run locally. To run the dashboard on your local machine please follow the subsequent steps:
1. make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed on your local machine. All dependencies are listed in [```requirements.txt```](requirements.txt).

## Dashboard Structure
The dashboard takes the data input produced by [```dashboard_data_prep.py```](https://github.com/nickzumbuehl/master_thesis/blob/master/masterthesis/dashboard_data_prep.py). This data are then visualized and accuracy measures are computed.
